Neighbourhood Measurement is a experimental program used for the evaluating the effectiveness of
current research in community detection for attributed graph-based networks.

Using a metric that assesses the internal similarity of a subgraph and subgraph's
dissimilarity with external nodes, the program assigns nodes into the most appropriate
cluster. This process is carried out on a node by node basis, where each node is
assigned to a cluster with which it has the highest affinity.
